## OGC KML 2.2 Conformance Test Suite

### Scope

This test suite checks KML 2.2 documents for conformance to _OGC KML, Version 
2.2.0_ ([OGC 07-147r2](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=27810)). 
All three conformance levels are covered:

* Level 1: includes test cases covering mandatory requirements that must be 
satisfied by every document;
* Level 2: as for Level 1, plus test cases addressing recommended constraints;
* Level 3: as for Level 2, plus test cases for suggested constraints that are 
purely informative in nature.

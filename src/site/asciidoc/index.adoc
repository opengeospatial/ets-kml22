= KML 2.2 Conformance Test Suite

== Scope

This test suite validates KML 2.2 documents according to the following specifications:

* [OGC-07-147r2] [OGCÂ® KML 2.2.0](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=27810[http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=27810])
* [OGC-07-134r2] [OGC KML 2.2 - Abstract Test Suite](ats-kml-2.2.html)

Three conformance levels are defined, where each level builds upon the lower level by adding additional constraints. Level 2 extends Level 1, and Level 3 is based on Level 2. A conforming implementation must produce documents that validate at level 1 in order to obtain an OGC compliance certificate.

* _Level 1_ - includes test cases covering requirements that must be satisfied by a minimally conformant document;
* _Level 2_ - as for Level 1, plus test cases addressing recommended constraints;
* _Level 3_ - as for Level 2, plus test cases covering suggested constraints that are informative in nature.

== Organization of the test suite

The test suite implements the test cases defined in the abstract test suite (ATS). The Java implementation classes generally correspond to a logical theme. For example the `TemporalElementTests` class realizes the following test cases:

* link:ats-kml-2.2.html#TimeSpan[ATC 4: TimeSpan]
* link:ats-kml-2.2.html#TimeStamp[ATC 5: TimeStamp]

All of the test cases are described in the link:ats-kml-2.2.html[ATS]. More details about the implementation are explained in the next section.

== Structure of the source code

The TestNG suite definition file (testng.xml) is located in the root package, `org.opengis.cite.kml22`. A conformance class corresponds to a <test /> element; each test element includes a set of test classes that contain the actual test methods. The essential structure of the test suite is shown in Table 1.

*Table 1 - Test suite structure*

|Conformance class |Test classes

The link:apidocs/index.html[Javadoc] documentation provides more detailed information about the test classes and test methods that comprise the suite.

== How to run the tests

The test suite may be run in any of the following environments:

* TEAM-Engine in a web application environment
* TEAM-Engine in a command-line environment: Run the CTL script located in the `/src/main/ctl/` directory.
* Integrated development environment (IDE): The main Java class is `TestNGController`.
* REST API: Submit a request that includes the necessary arguments to the test run controller (/rest/suites/kml22/${project.version}/run).

The test run arguments are summarized in Table 2. The value domain is expressed in terms of XML Schema datatypes for convenience. The _Obligation_ descriptor can have the following values: M (mandatory), O (optional), or C (conditional).

*Table 2 - Test run arguments*

|===
|Name |Value domain |Obligation |Description 

|iut |anyURI |M |A URI that refers to the instance document under test. Ampersand ('&amp;') characters must be percent-encoded as '%26'. 
|ics |positiveInteger |O |Indicates which conformance level (1-3) will be used to validate the instance document. If not specified, the lowest conformance level will be checked (ics=1).

== Reference implementation and sample files

The reference implementation is the http://gdal.org/ogr/drv_libkml.html[LIBKML Driver] in the GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library ) 1.11.0 library. Sample files created using the driver are available in a zip file link:Supporting_Docs_KML_2.2_GDAL.zip[here].
